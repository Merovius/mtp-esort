# esort

> Package esort provides mechanisms for sorting user-defined types according
> to compound criteria extensibly.  It is mutually compatible with package sort
> from the standard library.  The package name comes from the combination of
> the words "extensible" and "sort" and shortened as "esort."

This is an experimental library.
